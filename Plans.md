Future work
- Make text centered by default
- Better select tool? Maybe eyen with the square with the scale and move handles around it? 
- Double click things to edit them (texts, Polylines)
- Double click empty place on page to draw polyline (or other tool)
- Overhaul the line editing tool, auto close & more stuff
- Is it possible (to some extend) to see an error log if an ipelet fails to load, instead of just the window closing directly
- Tab and Shift+Tab for next / prev selection
- Ctrl+Shift+H to cycle the following states of the active layer: Hide all other layers, hide exactly this layer, show all layers
- unset F1, F2 and F3 
- ctrl+space to switch to the layer of the selection (does this exist already?)
- Is there an option to stretch with shift mouse that just needs to be enabled?
- How easy would it be to make P close if start node is clicked or so? And remove doubles and so
- Make ctrl+shift left+right switch the selected layers? (or swap with grid)
- ctrl+tab and ctrl+shift+tab for cycling through views AND pages? <- this is just a different key assignment

Stuff that would require work in C++
- Multiple shortcuts possible (on OSX)
- Drag drop for layers in the gui
- Shift-clicking un-ticks everything but the current 
- Apply the color when clicking it; only shift+click opens color chooser dialog
- Make layers highlight contained objects on hover (rest gets 50% opacity or so, maybe?)
