# IpeMods
Small ipelet that make various improvements to the drawing tool Ipe

Currently contains: 

- `Ctrl+Shift+C / V` for picking up and applying styles
- Duplicate with `Ctrl+D`
- Movement along gridsize using arrow keys (`Shift` for 1/4 speed)
- Change gridsize with `Ctrl+Up / Down`

Future work
- Make text centered by default
- `Ctrl+D` Duplicates at cursor (like paste at cursor)
- Multiple shortcuts possible
- Grid size 8 by start, instead of 16
